# Disease Prediction From Symptoms Using Machine Learning

The main aim of this project is to build a machine-learning model with the given datasets that can predict diseases from symptoms.

### Abstract

With the fast advancement of technology and data, the healthcare sector is currently one of the most important study areas. Managing the vast volume of patient data is challenging. Big Data Analytics makes handling this data simpler. There are several methods used all around the world to cure various ailments. A new method that aids in illness detection and prediction is machine learning. In this study, machine learning is used to predict illness based on symptoms. On the presented dataset, machine learning methods like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are used to forecast the illness. Through the use of the Python programming language, it is implemented.

### Introduction

Disease Prediction using Machine Learning is a method that forecasts the disease based on the data the user provides. Additionally, it accurately forecasts the user's or the patient's disease based on the data or symptoms entered into the system and returns findings accordingly. If the customer only wants to know the sort of ailment the patient has experienced, and the condition is not particularly significant. It is a system that gives users advice on how to keep their health systems in good shape and offers a technique to identify diseases using this prediction. Today's health sector plays a significant role in treating patients' illnesses, so this is frequently helpful for the sector to inform the user as well as helpful for the user in case he or she chooses not to visit the hospital or other clinics. By entering the symptoms and all other relevant information, the user can understand the disease they are experiencing.

#### Data

The dataset has been taken from Kaggle Data set.

•	All the features of the dataset are categorical (i.e., each feature/symptom has a binary value of 0 or 1) which implies whether the disease has this symptom or not. 
•	The data file has 133 columns. 132 of these columns are symptoms that a person experiences and last column is the prognosis and a total of 4920 rows/instances. 
 
The head of the data or the first five rows of the data look as the following –

### Data Preparation
#### Data Analysis

 •	Here the data type of symptoms is int64 and of the target variable(prognosis) is object which are strings.            
 •	These symptoms are mapped to 42 diseases that can classify these set of symptoms to.                       
    The 42 diseases are –                                                                                    
    'Fungal infection', 'Allergy', 'GERD', 'Chronic cholestasis', 'Drug Reaction', 'Peptic ulcer disease’, 'AIDS', 'Diabetes     ', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Bronchial Asthma', 'Hypertension ', 'Migraine', 'Cervical  spondylosis', 'Paralysis (brain            hemorrhage)', 'Jaundice', 'Malaria', 'Chicken pox', 'Dengue’, ‘Typhoid’, 'hepatitis A', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C',        'Hepatitis D', 'Hepatitis E', 'Alcoholic hepatitis’, ‘Tuberculosis', 'Common Cold', 'Pneumonia','Dimorphic                   hemmorhoids(piles)', 'Heartattack’,'Varicose veins', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Hyperthyroidism', 'Hypoglycemia',                    'Osteoarthristis', 'Arthritis’,'(vertigo) Paroymsal Positional Vertigo', 'Acne', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Psoriasis',     'Impetigo’  
 
 •	The dataset is completely balanced which means that each disease has 120 sets of data/rows
